# matplotlib-challange
This project is from the perspective of a senior data analyst of a pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, called Pymaceuticals. Inc. The company specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occuring form of skin cancer. 

As a senior data analyst, I am given access to the complete data from the company's most recent animal study. In the study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
